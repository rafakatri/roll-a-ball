## Try it yourself!

## Description

Collect all coins before the time limit! Beware the monsters that will follow you and block your way. 

More coins and monsters will spawn after you are done and the timer will reset. Keep playing over and over with an increasing difficulty!

Enjoy the upbeat klezmer music with three songs: Odessa Bulgar, Happy Nigun and Tates freilach. One of them is used for the game menu and the other two are randomly selected on each playthrough.

Roll a Ball project for Insper`s digital games course, made with Unity.
